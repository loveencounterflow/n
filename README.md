# n
(obsolete) fork of tj/n

This repo was a stopgap solution to get a version of [tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n) with support for [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html); as of January 1025, you can simply `npm install -g tj/n` to get that, so this repo is no longer needed. Head over to [my how-to](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/how-to) to read more on installing `n` and io.js.
